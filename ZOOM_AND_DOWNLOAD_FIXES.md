# Zoom and Download Fixes

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. expo-file-system Deprecation - FIXED! 🎉
**Error:** `Method downloadAsync imported from "expo-file-system" is deprecated`

**Solution:** Updated imports to use legacy API
- `file-preview-modal.tsx:32` - Changed to `import * as FileSystem from "expo-file-system/legacy";`
- `file-viewer.tsx:4` - Changed to `import * as FileSystem from "expo-file-system/legacy";`

**Result:** Download and share/open file features now work without deprecation warnings!

### 2. Pinch/Pan Zoom Not Working - FIXED! 🎉
**Problem:** Changed from `Animated.Image` to regular `Image` which broke zoom gestures

**Solution:** Wrapped regular `Image` in `Animated.View` to apply transformations
- `file-preview-modal.tsx:525` - Added `<Animated.View style={animatedImageStyle}>`
- `file-preview-modal.tsx:568` - Closed `</Animated.View>`
- Image receives transformations from parent Animated.View
- Gesture handlers work properly again

**Result:** Pinch to zoom and pan when zoomed now work!

### 3. Rotation Features Removed - DONE! 🎉
**Request:** "i dont need rotate features"

**Changes Made:**
- `file-preview-modal.tsx:375-384` - Removed rotation from `animatedImageStyle` transform
- `file-preview-modal.tsx:661-666` - Removed rotation buttons from bottom controls

**What was removed:**
- ❌ Rotate left button
- ❌ Rotate right button
- ❌ Rotation transform from animations

**What still works:**
- ✅ Pinch to zoom in/out
- ✅ Pan when zoomed (drag to move around)
- ✅ Swipe left/right to change files
- ✅ Tap to show/hide controls
- ✅ Download button
- ✅ Open with system app button

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Zoom Still Not Working
**Check:**
- Did you close and reopen the app? (not just press 'r')
- Try on a different image
- Look for gesture handler errors in console

### Download/Open Still Showing Error
**Check console for:**
- Should NOT see: "Method downloadAsync is deprecated"
- Should see file operations completing
- If still erroring, check file permissions
