Leaders should only see data for team members in their sector or managed sector:

```typescript
// User Query Filter (for team members)
{
  where: {
    position: {
      sectorId: currentUser.managedSectorId || currentUser.sectorId
    }
  }
}

// Vacation Query Filter
{
  where: {
    user: {
      position: {
        sectorId: currentUser.managedSectorId || currentUser.sectorId
      }
    },
    status: 'PENDING' // for approvals
  }
}

// Loan Query Filter
{
  where: {
    user: {
      position: {
        sectorId: currentUser.managedSectorId || currentUser.sectorId
      }
    }
  }
}

// Warning Query Filter
{
  where: {
    user: {
      position: {
        sectorId: currentUser.managedSectorId || currentUser.sectorId
      }
    }
  }
}
```

   - `POST /vacations/:id/reject` - Reject vacation

3. **Warning Endpoints** (`/api-client/warning.ts`)
   - `GET /warnings` - List warnings with filters
   - `GET /warnings/:id` - Get warning details

4. **Borrow/Loan Endpoints** (`/api-client/borrow.ts`)
   - `GET /borrows` - List loans with filters
   - `GET /borrows/:id` - Get loan details
   - `PATCH /borrows/:id` - Update loan status
