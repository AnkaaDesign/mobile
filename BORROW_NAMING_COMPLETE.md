**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Status**: ✅ 100% COMPLETE
**Scope**: Renamed all "loans" references to "borrows" for internal consistency

---

## Summary

Successfully updated the entire mobile application to use "borrow" naming instead of "loans" for internal consistency with the API entity names.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Folder Renames ✅

**Inventory Module:**
- ✅ `/inventory/loans/` → `/inventory/borrows/`
- ✅ All subdirectories (create.tsx, list.tsx, details/[id].tsx, edit/[id].tsx)

**Personal Module:**
- ✅ `/personal/my-loans.tsx` → `/personal/my-borrows.tsx`
- ✅ `/personal/my-loans/` → `/personal/my-borrows/`

**My Team Module:**
- ✅ `/my-team/loans.tsx` → `/my-team/borrows.tsx`

### 2. Routes Configuration (`src/constants/routes.ts`) ✅

**Inventory:**
```typescript
// OLD: inventory.loans
// NEW: inventory.borrows
borrows: {
  batchEdit: "/estoque/emprestimos/editar-lote",
  create: "/estoque/emprestimos/cadastrar",
  details: (id: string) => `/estoque/emprestimos/detalhes/${id}`,
  list: "/estoque/emprestimos",
  root: "/estoque/emprestimos",
}
```

**Personal:**
```typescript
// OLD: personal.myLoans
// NEW: personal.myBorrows
myBorrows: {
  details: (id: string) => `/pessoal/meus-emprestimos/detalhes/${id}`,
  root: "/pessoal/meus-emprestimos",
}
```

**My Team:**
```typescript
// OLD: myTeam.loans
// NEW: myTeam.borrows
myTeam: {
  borrows: "/meu-pessoal/emprestimos",
  vacations: "/meu-pessoal/ferias",
  warnings: "/meu-pessoal/avisos",
}
```

### 3. Screen Registrations (`_layout.tsx`) ✅

**Updated all screen names:**
- `inventory/loans/*` → `inventory/borrows/*`
- `personal/my-loans` → `personal/my-borrows`
- `my-team/loans` → `my-team/borrows`

### 4. Navigation References ✅

**Updated route-mapper.ts:**
- All `routes.inventory.loans` → `routes.inventory.borrows`
- All `routes.personal.myLoans` → `routes.personal.myBorrows`
- All `routes.myTeam.loans` → `routes.myTeam.borrows`

**Updated component files:**
- `src/app/(tabs)/inventory/borrows/list.tsx`
- `src/app/(tabs)/inventory/borrows/create.tsx`
- `src/app/(tabs)/inventory/borrows/edit/[id].tsx`
- `src/components/administration/change-log/detail/entity-link-card.tsx`

### 5. Additional Cleanup ✅

**Fixed production/cutting:**
- Changed `useTeamCutsInfiniteMobile` → `useCutsInfiniteMobile` in `/production/cutting/list.tsx`

**Cleaned route-mapper.ts:**
- Removed non-existent personal routes (myActivities, myCommissions, myPayroll, myPpeDeliveries, myTimeCalculations)
- Removed non-existent myTeam routes (activities, cuts, ppeDeliveries, timeCalculations, users)
- Removed duplicate route mappings

## Terminology Consistency

| Aspect | Before | After | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Route Key | `loans` | `borrows` | ✅ Updated |
| Folder Name | `loans` | `borrows` | ✅ Updated |
| File Name | `loans.tsx` | `borrows.tsx` | ✅ Updated |
| API Entity | `Borrow` | `Borrow` | ✅ Already correct |
| Hook Name | `useBorrows...` | `useBorrows...` | ✅ Already correct |
| Component | `Borrow...` | `Borrow...` | ✅ Already correct |
| Portuguese URL | `/emprestimos` | `/emprestimos` | ✅ Unchanged |

---

## Rationale

**Why "borrow" instead of "loans"?**

1. **API Consistency**: The backend API entity is called `Borrow`
2. **Component Consistency**: All components use `Borrow` naming (BorrowTable, BorrowForm, etc.)
3. **Hook Consistency**: All hooks use `useBorrow...` naming
4. **Type Consistency**: All TypeScript types use `Borrow` naming
5. **Internal Alignment**: Routes now match the internal entity name

**Note**: The Portuguese user-facing URLs remain `/emprestimos` (loans) which is correct for users, but internally the code uses "borrow" terminology for consistency with the API.

---

## Files Modified

**Renamed:**
- `/inventory/loans/` → `/inventory/borrows/`
- `/personal/my-loans.tsx` → `/personal/my-borrows.tsx`
- `/personal/my-loans/` → `/personal/my-borrows/`
- `/my-team/loans.tsx` → `/my-team/borrows.tsx`

**Updated:**
1. `src/constants/routes.ts` - 3 route sections updated
2. `src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - 10 screen registrations updated
3. `src/lib/route-mapper.ts` - All route mappings updated + cleanup
4. `src/app/(tabs)/inventory/borrows/list.tsx` - Route references updated
5. `src/app/(tabs)/inventory/borrows/create.tsx` - Route references updated
6. `src/app/(tabs)/inventory/borrows/edit/[id].tsx` - Route references updated
7. `src/components/administration/change-log/detail/entity-link-card.tsx` - Route references updated
8. `src/app/(tabs)/production/cutting/list.tsx` - Hook import fixed

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ All folders renamed successfully
- ✅ All route keys updated in routes.ts
- ✅ All screen registrations updated in _layout.tsx
- ✅ All navigation references updated
- ✅ All route-mapper entries updated
- ✅ No broken imports
- ✅ Hooks correctly reference `useBorrowsInfiniteMobile`

## Breaking Changes

### For Developers

**Route References:**
- ⚠️ `routes.inventory.loans` → `routes.inventory.borrows`
- ⚠️ `routes.personal.myLoans` → `routes.personal.myBorrows`
- ⚠️ `routes.myTeam.loans` → `routes.myTeam.borrows`

**Navigation:**
- ⚠️ `/(tabs)/inventory/loans/*` → `/(tabs)/inventory/borrows/*`
- ⚠️ `/(tabs)/personal/my-loans` → `/(tabs)/personal/my-borrows`
- ⚠️ `/(tabs)/my-team/loans` → `/(tabs)/my-team/borrows`

### For Users

- ✅ **No breaking changes** - URLs remain the same (`/emprestimos`)
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ Navigation works as before

---

## Result

**100% internal consistency** achieved:
- ✅ API: `Borrow` entity
- ✅ Routes: `borrows` key
- ✅ Hooks: `useBorrows...`
- ✅ Components: `Borrow...`
- ✅ Types: `Borrow...`
- ✅ Folders: `borrows/`

The mobile application now has complete naming consistency using "borrow" terminology throughout the codebase while maintaining user-friendly Portuguese URLs.
