/**
 * Centralized Badge Color Configuration System
 *
 * This file defines a comprehensive, consistent color mapping for all badges
 * across the Ankaa application, ensuring no color duplication for different
 * statuses and maintaining semantic meaning.
 *
 * Color Philosophy:
 * - Green: Success, completed, positive actions (entry, approved, active)
 * - Red: Failure, cancelled, negative actions (exit, rejected, lost)
 * - Orange/Amber: Warning states (overdue, pending, partially complete)
 * - Blue: Information, in-progress, neutral active states
 * - Gray: Inactive, muted, disabled states
