# Expo Go vs Development Build - File Viewer Guide

## ✅ **ISSUE FIXED!**

The app now works in **both** Expo Go and Development Builds with smart fallbacks.

---

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### **The Problem**
- `react-native-pdf` requires native code
- Won't work in **Expo Go** (throws "native module doesn't exist" error)
- Crashes the app on import

### **The Solution**
Created **smart wrapper components** that:
- ✅ **Detect** if native modules are available
- ✅ **Load dynamically** to avoid Expo Go crashes
- ✅ **Fallback gracefully** to share sheet in Expo Go
- ✅ **Use full features** in development builds

---

## 📱 Two Modes of Operation

### **Mode 1: Expo Go** (Quick Development)

**What Works:**
- ✅ Images → Full preview with zoom/pan/rotate
- ✅ PDFs → Shows alert, then shares to external app
- ✅ Videos → Shows alert, then shares to external app
- ✅ Documents → Shares to external apps
- ✅ All other file operations

**What You'll See:**
```
User clicks PDF → Alert: "PDF viewer requires development build.
                          Opening with external app..."
                → Share sheet opens → User picks PDF reader
```

**How to Use:**
```bash
npx expo start
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

**Best For:**
- Quick testing
- UI/UX development
- Non-PDF/video features

---

### **Mode 2: Development Build** (Full Features)

**What Works:**
- ✅ Images → Full preview with zoom/pan/rotate
- ✅ **PDFs → Native PDF viewer with page navigation** 🎉
- ✅ **Videos → Native video player with controls** 🎉
- ✅ Documents → Shares to external apps
- ✅ All file operations

**What You'll See:**
```
User clicks PDF → PDF viewer opens in-app
                → Full page navigation
                → Download/share buttons
```

**How to Build:**

#### **Option A: iOS**
```bash
# Prerequisites
# 1. Install Xcode from App Store
# 2. Run: sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

# Build
npx expo run:ios
```

#### **Option B: Android**
```bash
# Prerequisites
# 1. Install Android Studio
# 2. Setup Android SDK

# Build
npx expo run:android
```

#### **Option C: EAS Build** (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login
eas login

# Configure
eas build:configure

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

**Best For:**
- Production testing
- Full feature testing
- Final QA before release

---

## 🎯 Current Status

### **Expo Go: ✅ WORKING**
```bash
npx expo start
```
- App loads without crashing
- Images work perfectly
- PDFs/Videos fallback to share

### **Development Build: ✅ READY**
```bash
# iOS
npx expo run:ios

# Android
npx expo run:android
```
- Full PDF viewer available
- Full video player available
- All features work

## 🔍 How the Wrappers Work

### **PDF Viewer Wrapper**
```typescript
// Tries to load native PDF module
try {
  const module = await import('./pdf-viewer');
  // ✅ Success - use native PDF viewer
} catch (error) {
  // ❌ Failed - fallback to share sheet
  Alert.alert('PDF viewer requires development build...');
  shareFile(file);
}
```

### **Video Player Wrapper**
```typescript
// Same logic as PDF
try {
  const module = await import('./video-player');
  // ✅ Success - use native video player
} catch (error) {
  // ❌ Failed - fallback to share sheet
  Alert.alert('Video player requires development build...');
  shareFile(file);
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Native module doesn't exist" in Expo Go**
✅ **Expected behavior!** PDFs/Videos will fallback to share.

### **Want to test PDF/Video in development?**
```bash
npx expo run:ios  # or android
```

### **Xcode not installed (iOS)**
```bash
# 1. Install from App Store
# 2. Run:
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

### **Android SDK not set up (Android)**
1. Install Android Studio
2. Open Android Studio
3. Tools → SDK Manager → Install latest SDK
4. Set `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable
