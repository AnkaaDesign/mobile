# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Authentication Login Error

You're getting "nÃ£o autorizado" because there's still a **corrupted token in storage** from before the fixes.

## Quick Fix (Choose ONE method)

### METHOD 1: Clear Cache via Dev Menu (FASTEST) âš¡
1. **Shake your device** or press `Cmd+D` (iOS Simulator) / `Cmd+M` (Android)
2. Tap **"Settings"**
3. Tap **"Clear AsyncStorage"**
4. Go back and tap **"Reload"**
5. Try logging in again

### METHOD 2: Complete App Reset
```bash
# Stop your server first (Ctrl+C), then run:
npx expo start --clear
```

### METHOD 3: Clear via Browser Console
1. While app is running, press `j` in terminal to open debugger
2. Paste this in browser console:
```javascript
(async () => {
  const AsyncStorage = require("@react-native-async-storage/async-storage").default;
  await AsyncStorage.clear();
  console.log("âœ… All storage cleared!");
})();
```
3. Press `r` in terminal to reload app
4. Try logging in

## What I Fixed

1. âœ… **Removed broken refresh token logic** - Your API doesn't use traditional refresh tokens
2. âœ… **Prevented tokens from being sent to login/register** - Public endpoints shouldn't receive tokens
3. âœ… **Auto-clear corrupted tokens on startup** - Invalid tokens are now detected and removed
4. âœ… **Clear auth state before login** - Ensures clean state for each login attempt
5. âœ… **Fixed duplicate notifications** - Auth operations no longer show automatic success toasts

## After Clearing Storage

You should be able to:
- âœ… Login successfully without "nÃ£o autorizado" error
- âœ… Access all pages (Customers, etc.) without 401 errors
- âœ… See only ONE notification per action
- âœ… Proper logout and redirect on auth errors

## If You Still Get Errors

Check the console logs for:
```
[AUTH DEBUG] Clearing any existing auth state before login
[API CLIENT DEBUG] Calling tokenProvider to get token for /auth/login
```

If you see a token being sent to `/auth/login`, let me know!
