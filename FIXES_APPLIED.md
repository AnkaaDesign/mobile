# âœ… FIXES APPLIED - App is Now Working!

## ðŸŽ‰ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

Your app is now **crash-free** and works in both Expo Go and development builds!

---

## ðŸ”§ What Was Broken

**Original Error:**
```
ERROR: Your JavaScript code tried to access a native module that doesn't exist.
```

**Root Cause:** `react-native-pdf` requires native code, can't work in Expo Go

---

## âœ… What I Fixed

### **Created Smart Wrapper Components:**
- `pdf-viewer-wrapper.tsx` - Dynamically loads PDF viewer
- `video-player-wrapper.tsx` - Dynamically loads video player

**Expo Go:** Shows alert, then shares to external app  
**Dev Build:** Uses full native viewers

- Images â†’ Preview in-app âœ…
