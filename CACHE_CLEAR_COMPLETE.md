## 📱 NEXT: Delete App from Device

**CRITICAL:** You must delete the app from your device/simulator to clear the app's bundle cache.

### For iOS Simulator:
```bash
# Option 1: Long press app icon → Remove App → Delete App

# Option 2: Reset all simulators
xcrun simctl erase all
```

### For Physical Device:
1. Long press app icon
2. Tap "Remove App"
3. Select "Delete App"

### Then Reinstall:
```bash
# For iOS
npx expo run:ios --clear

# For Android
npx expo run:android --clear

# OR scan QR code with Expo Go
npx expo start
```

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Console Logs
Look for these in your terminal when you open a file:
```
🔍 File URL: http://your-api:3030/files/serve/abc123
🔍 API Base: http://your-api:3030
```

**Should NOT see:**
```
❌ http://your-api:3030/api/files/serve/abc123
```

### 2. Check Network Requests
Enable React Native Debugger or use Flipper to see network requests.

**Expected requests:**
```
✅ GET /files/serve/{id}
✅ GET /files/thumbnail/{id}?size=medium
✅ GET /files/{id}/download
```

### 3. Visual Verification
- ✅ File thumbnails should load immediately
- ✅ Full images should display in preview modal
- ✅ No "Erro ao carregar imagem" message
- ✅ No text rendering errors

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

If you still see problems after:
1. ✅ Clearing all caches (done)
2. ✅ Verifying code changes (done)
3. ⏳ Deleting and reinstalling app (do this next)

Then check:

### A. Environment Variables
```bash
cat .env
```
Verify `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` is correct.

### B. API Connectivity
Test in browser:
```
http://your-api-url:3030/files/serve/{real-file-id}
```
Should download/display the file.

### C. Backend Logs
Check if requests are reaching your backend:
```
# You should see requests like:
GET /files/serve/abc123
GET /files/thumbnail/abc123?size=medium
```

### D. Device Network
- Ensure device/simulator can reach your API
- Check firewall settings
- For physical device, use your computer's local IP
