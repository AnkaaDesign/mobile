## Reading Guide

### For Quick Understanding (15 minutes)
1. Read ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md (sections 1-4)
2. Review the alignment checklist
3. Skim the menu structure

### For Implementation (1-2 hours)
1. Read WEB_NAVIGATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md completely
2. Reference WEB_NAVIGATION_ANALYSIS.md for detailed patterns
3. Use file locations to review actual code

### For Architecture Review (2-3 hours)
1. Read WEB_NAVIGATION_ANALYSIS.md completely
2. Reference original source files in ../web/src/
3. Cross-reference with current mobile implementation
4. Document any additional discrepancies

---

## Key Findings

### Privilege Hierarchy (9 Levels)
```
1. BASIC (no advanced)
2. MAINTENANCE
3. WAREHOUSE
4. PRODUCTION
5. LEADER (team leadership)
6. HUMAN_RESOURCES
7. FINANCIAL
8. ADMIN (highest regular)
9. EXTERNAL
```

### Navigation Structure
- 13 top-level menu items
- 70+ total menu items
- Hierarchical nesting
- Multiple privilege requirements

### Routes Organization
- 14 major route groups
- Consistent URL patterns
- Type-safe constants
- Dynamic route parameters

### Implementation Patterns
- Hierarchical privilege checking for guards
- Exact matching for menu filtering
- Recursive menu filtering
- Platform-aware navigation
