## QUICK START - Key Findings

### The Web Version Uses:
- **Framework**: React + React Router v6
- **Structure**: `/src/pages` directory (NOT Next.js app directory)
- **Main Config**: `/src/constants/navigation.ts` - NAVIGATION_MENU array (1389 lines)
- **Route Constants**: `/src/constants/routes.ts` - Type-safe route definitions
- **Utilities**: `/src/utils/navigation.ts` - Helper functions for menu/privilege filtering

### Path Pattern (Consistent Throughout):
```
List:        /module/entity
Create:      /module/entity/cadastrar
Details:     /module/entity/detalhes/:id
Edit:        /module/entity/editar/:id
Batch Edit:  /module/entity/editar-em-lote
```

### Main Modules (11 Total):
1. Administração - Customers, Employees, Sectors, Notifications
2. Estoque - Loans, PPE, Suppliers, Maintenance, Orders, Products
3. Pintura - Catalog, Paint Types, Brands, Productions
4. Produção - Tasks (Cronograma), Cutting, Garages, Airbrushing
5. Recursos Humanos - Warnings, Positions, EPI, Holidays, Vacations, Payroll, Bonuses
6. Pessoal - Personal data (My Loans, My PPE, My Vacations, etc.)
7. Meu Pessoal - Team management for leaders
8. Servidor - System administration (backup, deployments, logs, metrics)
9. Integrações - Secullum integration
10. Estatísticas - Advanced analytics
11. Other - Home, Profile, Favorites, Maintenance, Finance

### Privilege System:
- 9 different privilege types (ADMIN, HUMAN_RESOURCES, PRODUCTION, WAREHOUSE, LEADER, DESIGNER, FINANCIAL, LOGISTIC, MAINTENANCE)
- Menu items filtered by single privilege or array of privileges (OR logic)
- Some items appear at top-level for specific users (e.g., "Cronograma" for DESIGNER/FINANCIAL/LOGISTIC)
- AutoPrivilegeRoute enforces permission checking

### Navigation Features:
- Lazy-loaded pages using React.lazy()
- Centralized navigation config (single source of truth)
- 400+ icon mappings (TABLER_ICONS)
- Dynamic routes with :id pattern
- Nested hierarchical menus
- Platform and environment filtering
- Breadcrumb generation
- Menu search and filtering utilities

## FOR MOBILE DEVELOPERS

### Essential Files to Reference:
1. `/web/src/constants/navigation.ts` - Copy NAVIGATION_MENU structure
2. `/web/src/constants/routes.ts` - Copy route patterns
3. `/web/src/utils/navigation.ts` - Adapt filtering logic

### Implementation Priority:
1. **Must have**: Same path names (Portuguese)
2. **Must have**: Same privilege system
3. **Must have**: Same route patterns (cadastrar, detalhes, editar)
4. **Important**: Nested navigation support
5. **Important**: Dynamic route parameters
6. **Nice to have**: Batch operations
7. **Nice to have**: Advanced features (statistics, integrations, server admin)

### What's Different:
- Web: Sidebar navigation, desktop optimizations
- Mobile: Likely tab/drawer navigation, mobile optimizations
- Web: All 11 modules
- Mobile: Probably subset (skip server admin, maybe integrate finance)

### Key Constraint:
**Keep all route names and patterns identical to web** for consistency and potentially shared navigation code.

## HOW TO USE THESE DOCUMENTS

### For Navigation Planning:
1. Read WEB_NAVIGATION_ANALYSIS.md overview section
2. Review module count and privilege requirements
3. Plan mobile navigation structure

### For Route Implementation:
1. Use WEB_VS_MOBILE_ROUTES_COMPARISON.md to see exact patterns
2. Implement routes in same pattern
3. Check privilege requirements for each section

### For File Organization:
1. Reference WEB_KEY_FILES_REFERENCE.md for structure
2. Consider organizing mobile similarly (pages by domain)
3. Keep API client and navigation config centralized

### For Privilege System:
1. Review privilege enum in WEB_KEY_FILES_REFERENCE.md
2. Implement privilege filtering in navigation
3. Apply same filtering logic to routes

## POTENTIAL GAPS & CONSIDERATIONS

### Features Likely Not on Mobile Yet:
- Server administration (backup, deployments, logs)
- Advanced statistics/analytics dashboards
- Payroll and bonus management
- Integrations (Secullum)
- Service orders
- Truck management
- Advanced formulations (paint module)
- Time clock integration

### Features That SHOULD Be on Mobile:
- Core tasks (Cronograma)
- Inventory management
- PPE management
- Basic HR (vacations, warnings)
- Personal data dashboard
- Team management (for leaders)
- Basic catalog browsing
- Customers/Suppliers

### Design Considerations:
1. Mobile will need different navigation pattern (tabs vs sidebar)
2. Some deep hierarchies might need flattening (e.g., estoque/epi/agendamentos)
3. Batch operations might be difficult on mobile
4. Statistics might need simplified version
5. Form complexity should be reduced for mobile

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Use WEB_VS_MOBILE_ROUTES_COMPARISON.md to identify which modules to implement
2. Create mobile screen/page structure matching route names
3. Implement privilege filtering in mobile navigation
4. Adapt layouts for mobile navigation patterns
5. Test privilege-based visibility
6. Verify route consistency with web version
