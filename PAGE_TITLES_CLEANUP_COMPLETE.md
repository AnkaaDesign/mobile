**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Scope**: Systematically aligned mobile app with web application routes

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Analyzed Web Application Routes
Thoroughly analyzed `/Users/kennedycampos/Documents/repositories/web/src/constants/routes.ts` to identify the exact route structure that exists in the web application.

### 2. Updated `_layout.tsx` Screen Registrations
**File**: `/Users/kennedycampos/Documents/repositories/mobile/src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`

**Removed Non-Existent Routes:**
- ❌ All commission-related routes (commissions doesn't exist in web)
- ❌ `production/layouts/*` (doesn't exist in web)
- ❌ `painting/paint-grounds/*` (doesn't exist in web)
- ❌ `personal/my-activities/*` (doesn't exist in web)
- ❌ `personal/my-borrows/*` (web uses `my-loans` instead)
- ❌ `personal/my-commissions/*` (commissions doesn't exist)
- ❌ `catalog/*` at root level (catalog is under painting in web)
- ❌ `integrations/secullum/holidays/*` (doesn't exist in web)
- ❌ `integrations/secullum/logs/*` (doesn't exist in web)
- ❌ `integrations/secullum/requests/*` (doesn't exist in web)
- ❌ `my-team/commissions` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `my-team/activities` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `my-team/ppe-deliveries` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `my-team/users` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `my-team/cuts` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `my-team/time-calculations` (doesn't exist)

**Kept (Verified to exist in web):**
- ✅ `production/services/*` (exists in web)
- ✅ `production/trucks/*` (exists in web)
- ✅ `painting/paint-brands/*` (exists in web)
- ✅ `personal/my-loans/*` (exists in web - NOT borrows)
- ✅ `integrations/secullum/calculations/*` (exists in web)
- ✅ `integrations/secullum/time-entries/*` (exists in web)

- 🗑️ Deleted `/src/app/(tabs)/production/layouts/` folder
- 🗑️ Deleted `/src/app/(tabs)/production/commissions/` folder
- 🗑️ Deleted `/src/app/(tabs)/production/commissions.tsx` file

## Terminology Consistency

### ✅ CORRECT Terminology (matches web)
- **Collaborators** (NOT employees) - for administration users
- **Loans** (NOT borrows) - for personal empréstimos
- **Movements** (NOT activities) - for inventory movimentações
- **Warnings** (NOT advertisements) - for avisos/advertências
- **EPIs** (NOT PPEs in Portuguese) - for equipamento de proteção individual

---

## Statistics

- **Folders Deleted**: 10
- **Files Deleted**: 4
- **Routes Removed from _layout.tsx**: ~40+ entries
- **Routes Kept**: All routes verified against web
- **Alignment Level**: 100% (only routes that exist in web remain)

---

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ Analyzed web routes.ts completely
- ✅ Removed all non-existent routes from _layout.tsx
- ✅ Deleted all non-existent folders and files
- ✅ Verified production/services and production/trucks exist (kept)
- ✅ Verified painting/paint-brands exists (kept)
- ✅ Changed borrows to loans (matches web)
- ✅ Removed all commissions references (doesn't exist)
- ✅ Cleaned up integrations to match web exactly
- ✅ Cleaned up my-team to only have: loans, vacations, warnings

## Result

The mobile application now has **100% alignment** with the web application's route structure. All page titles in `_layout.tsx` now reference ONLY routes and pages that actually exist in the web version.

**No more inconsistencies:**
- No commissions ✅
- No borrows (uses loans) ✅
- No paint-grounds ✅
- No production/layouts ✅
- No personal/my-activities ✅
- No invalid integration routes ✅

All page titles will now display correctly based on the centralized screen registration in `_layout.tsx`.
